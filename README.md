# :mortar_hat: Interactive raster visualization with R

In this workshop

- How to visualize rasters interactively
  - Start with htmlwidgets, developed by RStudio
  - Crash course in pipe operators -- need to know to work with most of these libraries
  - [plotly](https://plotly.com/r/)
    - [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plotly)
    - [maps with Plotly](https://plotly-r.com/maps.html)
    - [Interactive web-based data visualization with R, plotly, and Shiny](https://plotly-r.com/)
    - [Embedding images](https://plotly-r.com/embedding-images.html): possible solution for rasters in with plotly
    - [`Rasterly`](https://github.com/plotly/rasterly): other solution to visualize rasters using plotly
    - Still worth showing, considering that plotly offers a lot of interactive vizualization tools
